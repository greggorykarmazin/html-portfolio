My Favorite Teams

<h2>My Top 3</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>1. <a href="https://www.newyorkjets.com/"> New York Jets</a></h3>
<p>
  I dont know why but I cant quit you. No team causes me so much pain and yet pure joy at the same time. Every August I get excited and every November I'm giving you the finger.

<h3>2. <a href="https://www.nba.com/lakers/"> Los Angeles Lakers</a></h3>

<p>
  I loved you guys in my youth. I loved Kobe and looked up to him. I can't get down with Lebron. Ill be hard core again once he retires
